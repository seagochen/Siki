# README

This is a subset of one of my project, and I integrated some most useful and commonly functions and named it to Polygon. In order to speed up development of Python relative projects, and optimize the time.

Your are welcome and free to use this project in your own, because it follows the open-source protocol. And you are also welcome to pull your improvements to me to help this project be better. 

If have any problem about my project, ask me questions on Github's issues page, I'll answer you if I can.
